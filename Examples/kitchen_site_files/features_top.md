What is "Meteor Kitchen"?
=========================

"Meteor Kitchen" is a meteor application code generator. Just describe your application in a simple JSON file and let meteor-kitchen to build a (almost) complete Meteor application with:

- Directory structure
- Router and route controllers
- Collections (pubs & subs)
- Layout
- Pages (with content)
- Menus
- Forms (with validations)
- DataViews (components you can use to show data from collections with search & sort functions)

**And more:** in addition to built-in components you can write your own **plugins!** in javascript and expand the generator to infinity... and beyond!
